# Stronger Password

## Presentation

Simple PHP project dedicated to password security. It includes functionality for estimating the time it would take to crack a given password, taking into account factors such as the length and complexity of the password.

The time is calculated based on factors like the length of the password and the types of characters used (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and emojis).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: 
2. Open the `cracking-time.php` file.
3. Insert your password in the `$password` variable.
4. Run the PHP script to get the estimated time to crack the password.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that the actual time to crack a password can decrease over time due to advancements in technology and computing power. The estimates are based on current technology and methods, and they do not account for future developments.

Password security is a dynamic field. As technology advances, so do the tools and techniques employed by attackers.

To maintain a high level of security, it is recommended to regularly update your passwords and use a combination of letters, numbers, special characters, and even emojis. Furthermore, using longer and more complex passwords can significantly increase the time required to crack them.

Consider using additional security measures alongside strong passwords, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), for better protection.
